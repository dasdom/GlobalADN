=========

Test project from me to get used to Swift and develop best practices

Included are:

1. Unit Tests
2. Separation of UITableViewDataSource and the view controller
3. A light view controller
4. Building UI without Interface Builder
5. Self-sizing table view cells.
6. Parsing of a REST JSON response (in Swift using NSDictionaries and NSArrays)

I tried to think about what feels right in Swift and how a small iOS app in Swift could be structured.

Let me know what you think (on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dasdom) or [ADN](https://alpha.app.net/dasdom)).
